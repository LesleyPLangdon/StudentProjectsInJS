<p>This program will take the following string, convert it to an array, 
remove any duplicate words and display the new array.</p>

<p>JavaScript is case sensitive which means that JavaScript is 
read as a different word than javascript which is read as a different 
word than Javascript which is different from JAVASCRIPT or jAVAsCRIPT 
and still different from jAVASCRIPT but this program will read them all 
the same because it is converting all letters to lower case</p>
 
<p>Click "Show array" to display the array without any duplicate words.</p>

<button onclick="readText(text)">Show array</button>

	The shift method removes the first word of the array and moves the rest up a so the first word is
